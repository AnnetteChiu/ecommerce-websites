Every time you view, edit, or interact with content, the system records this with a score: View = 1.0 points, Edit = 2.0 points. Using cosine similarity, the system identifies users who interact with content that is similar to theirs. If you both like “AI” and “technology” articles, you’re identical users. The system recommends content that similar users liked but you haven’t seen yet. It combines this with content-based matching for better results. The Content Manager website enables people to develop the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in and contribute to our rapidly changing centre of ecommerce, social media, and business.
